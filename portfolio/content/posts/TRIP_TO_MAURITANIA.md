# FOREWORD

I recently went back on a trip to my home country of Mauritania after 5 years of living abroad, and it was unbeliaveable and  an amazing experience.

# About Me

My name is Demba Sow, and I'm a travel enthusiast. I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and trying new foods. Mauritania has been on my bucket list for a long time, and I'm so glad I finally had the opportunity to visit.


# Local Cuisine

One of the things I loved most about Mauritania was the local cuisine. I tried many different dishes, but one of my favorites was thieboudienne, which is a delicious mix of fish and rice. I also enjoyed mechoui, which is a roasted lamb dish that is typically served at special occasions and celebrations.

# Beautiful Landscapes

Mauritania is home to some of the most breathtaking landscapes I have ever seen. The Sahara desert is an obvious highlight, but there are many other places worth visiting as well. For example, Banc d'Arguin National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is known for its diverse bird population. The Adrar Plateau is another stunning location, with its rugged terrain and dramatic rock formations.

# Traditional Clothing and Jewelry

The Mauritanian people are known for their beautiful traditional clothing and jewelry. The boubou is a flowing garment that is worn by both men and women, and it is often decorated with intricate embroidery. The malafa is another traditional garment that is worn by women, and it covers the entire body except for the eyes. Mauritanian jewelry is also highly prized, with silver and gold being the most common materials used.

# Music and Dance

Music and dance are an integral part of Mauritanian culture. The tidinit is a popular harp-like instrument that is often played at weddings and other celebrations. The yela is a traditional dance that is performed by women and involves a lot of movement and rhythmic clapping.

# Local People and Daily Life

One of the highlights of my trip to Mauritania was getting to know the local people and learning about their daily lives, traditions, and beliefs. I was struck by their warmth and hospitality, and I felt welcomed everywhere I went.

Here is a video I took of some Mauritanian women weaving baskets:
